# BMI-CALCULATOR
I created a BMI calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input their height and weight, and based on that, the calculator provides an estimate of their body fat. This project allowed me to improve my web development skills and create a useful tool for health monitoring. I also used other Backend tools too.
